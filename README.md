Meetaverse is a project to be included inside a social network such as Instagram that connects people with restaurants, coffee shops and any other place people can meet at and earns a comission on every transaction.

The metaverse will someday become a reality and this will be the first step into that new reality.

First, people use Meetaverse to meet in real life.

And after, they meet in the metaverse.
